# This scripts allows to cycle through several
# keyboard layouts and provides visual feedback
# of success or failure. It is intended to be
# bound to a keyboard shortcut. If you want to
# change layouts by shell, you probably also
# want to change the method of feedback.

# Needs: setxkbmap, awk, libnotify-bin

# This is the list of available layouts. Note
# that entries have to come in triples.
# The first component of each triplet has to be a
# layout code that is understood by 'setxkbmap'.
# The second component has to be the layout's name
# as 'setxkbmap -print' prints it.
# The third component is a string printed in
# the notify box denoting the layout in human
# readable form.
# The fourth is the path to an image file that is
# also shown in the notify box. Leave it empty to
# have no image shown, but do not leave the element out!
# Note that tilde (~) expansion does not work.
# The first layout described will be considered
# default.
